# Next Boilerplate

A boilerplate for creating new projects with Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky & lint-staged. Bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/zysk/next-boilerplate.git
cd next-boilerplate
npm install
```

**_Important_**

After installing the dependencies, don't forget the below mentioned steps

- Change your repository's git origin to the project's git repo using the command below

  ```
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zysk/repo-url.git
  ```

  For ex: If you are working on a website called gojek and its git repository URL is https://github.com/zysk/gojek.git, then

  ```
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zysk/gojek.git
  ```

- Rename your folder to the name of the project you are working on

Then, you can start the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```
